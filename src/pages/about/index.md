title: About Robin's Nest Bakery

### How we started
Robin’s Nest Bakery was established by Robin Johnson, the baker, creator and founder. Robin has always had an interest in the culinary world but decided to go to college at the University of Texas - San Antonio where she earned her degrees but that just wasn’t enough for her. Although she has been baking and cooking for over a decade she moved to Houston last year to pursue her passion for pastry. She landed a job at CommonBond Cafe and Bakery where she began to make macarons for all the store front locations in Houston. After being there almost a year inspired by what she had learned, she decided to move back to San Antonio and branch out on her own in order to follow her culinary dreams.

### What we do
We specialize in making amazing cakes, cheesecakes, cookies, macarons, pies and many more. We loves to think outside of the box and encourages her clients to do the same. We strive to make your pastry dreams a beautiful reality.
